WOO- saving paws, one tap at a time
Woo, has embarked on a mission to make a difference in the lives of our beloved four-legged companions. In a world where dogs often face hardships and adversity, Woo is designed with a heart full of compassion and a commitment to their welfare.

Woo's primary focus is on three key pillars:
Shelter for Dogs: Woo provides a safe haven for homeless dogs, ensuring they have a place to call home while awaiting their forever families.

Rescue Operations: The app is dedicated to rescuing dogs in distress, from perilous situations or environments where they need immediate assistance.

Vet Care: Woo ensures that every dog receives the medical attention they require, ensuring their health and well-being.

User Upload: Woo also enables users to upload pictures of dogs and essential information, allowing other users to view them and take appropriate actions.

Furthermore, this achievement wouldn't have been possible without the invaluable assistance of my friend Rishita Dhar, who oversaw the entire app designing process.
This remarkable initiative exemplifies the power of technology and compassion coming together to create a brighter future for our furry friends.
